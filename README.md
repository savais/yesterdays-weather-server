# Yesterday's Weather - Backend

### What?
This project provides a backend for a weather app that specializes in showing you the past days weather in Finland. It uses openly available data from the Finnish Meteorological Institute. It is not designed to be 100% accurate, the backend makes assumptions and conversions from forecast data to observational data which are less than scientific.

### Why?
The purpose of this project is entirely educational. It was made to test and improve my skills.
